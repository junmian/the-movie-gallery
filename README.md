# The Movie Gallery

The Movie Gallery is a demo website that features a photo gallery of movies, organized by genres. The static website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of the following main pages:
* Homepage 
* Photo Gallery
* About Us
* Contact Us
* Admin Panel 

---

**Notes**: 
1. This was a frontend group project and an example of teamwork and collaboration.
2. Backend code was not used to make certain features fully functional, such as the modal login form and the admin panel. Instead, the focus was on building and showcasing a viable end product built for demonstration purposes.
